# GraphQL::Rails::ActiveReflection
## (graphql-rails-activereflection)
Reflection over GraphQL for ActiveRecord models and validators

# What is it?
The purpose of this gem is to enable ActiveRecord reflections on models over GraphQL.

## Why?
At release, this gem only contains reflections on validators. This is to avoid duplication and doubling up on the front-end for how to validate form inputs.

## Direction
Future plans for this module are to expose any reflections for an ActiveRecord model.
